You are an architect creating a Jira ticket for a senior dev. Look at
#file:dynamic-compose-system.md for the current implementation. We want to

amd64 in the dynamic-compose schema. These override will then be merged on top
of the base schema before passing it to the builder.

Write down the Jira task in docs/jira for the senior dev
