# Runtipi Progress

## What Works

Based on the repository analysis, the following core functionality appears to be working:

1. **Core Platform**: The main Runtipi platform with web UI, backend services, and Docker orchestration
2. **App Store**: A repository of 268+ applications available for installation
3. **User Management**: Registration, login, and password reset functionality
4. **App Management**: Installation, configuration, and removal of applications
5. **Networking**: Traefik-based reverse proxy with automatic routing
6. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization with multiple languages available
7. **Guest Dashboard**: A public view of selected applications for non-authenticated users
8. **E2E Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end test suite for core functionality

## What's Left to Build

Without specific roadmap information, potential areas for future development include:

1. **Enhanced Security Features**: Additional security hardening and options
2. **Advanced Resource Management**: Better control over resource allocation for applications
3. **Backup & Restore System**: More comprehensive backup solutions
4. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Improved system monitoring and notification system
5. **Mobile Experience**: Further refinement of mobile interfaces
6. **Integration Options**: More ways for applications to integrate with each other
7. **Plugin System**: Extensibility beyond the current app store model

## Current Status

The project appears to be in a mature state with active development and community participation. The core functionality is established, and the focus appears to be on refinement, expansion, and maintenance.

### Key Metrics:
- 268+ available applications in the app store
- Multiple language translations
- 53+ contributors (as indicated in the README)
- Active testing infrastructure
- Established community on Discord and Forums

## Known Issues

Without specific issue tracking analysis, common areas for improvement might include:

1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Despite simplification efforts, initial server setup can still be challenging
2. **Resource Consumption**: Docker overhead on low-end systems
3. **Application Compatibility**: Ensuring all apps work well together and with the core system
4. **Update Management**: Handling updates for both the platform and individual applications
5. **Networking Edge Cases**: Complex network configurations can cause issues

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The project has likely evolved in the following ways:

1. **Architecture Refinement**: Moving from a simpler structure to a more modular, maintainable codebase
2. **Expanding App Store**: Growing from a small set of core applications to hundreds of options
3. **Testing Emphasis**: Development of comprehensive testing strategies for reliability
4. **Community Focus**: Increasing emphasis on community contributions and translations
5. **Documentation Improvement**: More comprehensive guides and documentation for users
6. **Deployment Simplification**: Continued refinement of the installation and update process
7. **Version Migration**: Scripts for updating between major versions (2.0.0 to 3.0.0, 3.0.0 to 4.0.0) suggest significant evolutions in the platform architecture

The project demonstrates ongoing evolution with a focus on user experience, stability, and expanding the ecosystem of available applications.
