Matrix is an ambitious new ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
VoIP.  The basics you need to know to get up and running are:

- Everything in Matrix happens in a room.  Rooms are distributed and do not
  exist on any single server.  Rooms can be located using convenience aliases
  like ``#matrix:matrix.org`` or ``#test:localhost:8448``.

- Matrix user IDs look like ``@matthew:matrix.org`` (although in the future
  you will normally refer to yourself and others using a third party identifier
  (3PID): email address, phone number, etc rather than manipulating Matrix user IDs)
